# spotify-libre-scrobbler

Script to scrobble your Spotify's recently played tracks to libre.fm.

Unfortunately, Spotify only saves the last 50 recent played tracks, so you'd have to run this script
multiple times to prevent losing scrobbles. For now I have my own private way to handle that,
but maybe someday I'll work on this to provide a better way for everyone.

## Configuration

Update the `default-config.ini` file according to your private info.
